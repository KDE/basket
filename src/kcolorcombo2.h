/**
 * @short A combobox to display or allow user selection of a color in a user-friendly way.
 *
 * A combobox widget that popup an array of colors for the user to easily pick a common color.\n
 * He/she can use the popup to quickly pick a reasonable color or open a color chooser dialog for a more precise choice.\n
 * The user can also choose a default color (the standard background color, text color, etc... it's to the programmer to make sense of this property).\n
 * \n
 * The user is also offered some facilities: like KColorButton he/she can copy a color or paste it
 * (with standard keyboard shortcuts, usually Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V), and he/she can drag or drop colors.
 *
 * @par Quick usage:
 * Just create a new KColorCombo2() with the initial color and eventually an allowed default color
 * (eg. palette().color(QPalette::Base) for a background color, palette().color(QPalette::Text)...).\n
 * You will be noticed of the color the user selects with the signal changed(), or you can use color() to get the color at any moment.\n
 * Note that they can return an invalid color (see QColor::isValid()) if the user chosen the default color (if he can choose that).\n
 * It's then easy to save in settings, but if you want the real color (even for the default), you can get it with effectiveColor().
 *
 * @par Notes about default color:
 * If you set a default color using Qt or KDE standard colors, the user can change them in the KDE Control Center,
 * but this widget willn't be update and will still show the old one.\n
 * To be noticed of such color change and then update the widget with the new standard color, you can use one of those two methods:
 * @code
 * void QWidgetDerivate::paletteChange(const QPalette &oldPalette) { // QWidgetDerivate is a parent or near custom widget
 *     theComboBox->setDefaultColor(theNewDefaultColor);
 *     QWidget::paletteChange(oldPalette);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * or connect the signal QApplication::kdisplayPaletteChanged() to a slot that will set the default color of this widget.
 *
 * @par Advanced usage:
 * By default, the combobox show a well balanced rainbow, OK for most usages, and you don't need to do anything for it to work.\n
 * You however can set your own color array by calling newColorArray() with the number of columns and rows.
 * Then, setColorAt() several times to fill the array.\n
 * This allow the most flexibility. But if you just want a rainbow with more or less colors, setRainbowPreset() is what you want.\n
 * If you worry about performance issues of creating a combobox with the default color array and then allocating another color array by yourself,
 * note that the default color array is not allocated in the constructor, but as soon as it is demanded (on first popup if no array has been
 * set before, or on first call of any accessors: colorAt(), columnCount(), setColorAt()...).
 * Finally, colorRectPixmap() and drawColorRect() allow to draw the color rounded-rectangle in other places for a consistent look.
 *
 * @see KGlobalSettings Use one of the static functions to get KDE standard colors for default values.
 * @see KColorButton    The same, but without the rainbow popup or the choice of a default color.
 * @see QColorDialog    The dialog that is shown when the user click the "Other..." entry.

     * @li The default values are good to have the 7 colors of the rainbow + colors between them, and light/dark colors are well distinct.
     * @li If the color is a background color, you can set @p darkRowCount to 0, so only light colors are shown.
     * @li The inverse is true for text color choice: you can set @p lightRowCount to 0.
     * @li But be careful: some advanced users prefer white text on dark background, so you eg. can set @p lightRowCount to a big value and
     *     @p darkRowCount to a small one for a fewer choice of dark colors, but at least some ones.

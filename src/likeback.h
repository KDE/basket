/**
 * @short System to Get Quick Feedback from Beta-Testers
 *
 * This system allows users to communicate their liking of the application to its developers.
 * Thus, developers know what their users prefer of their applications, what should be enhanced, etc.
 *
 * Basically, how does it work?
 * Whenever the user notice something good he appreciate or something he do not like, do not understand, do not find polished...
 * he can send a few short words to the developers to tell them what he like or do not like. It is only two or three clicks away.
 * It is fast and efficient.
 *
 * This greatly lowers the communication barrier between the application developers and the application users.
 * It makes the developers understand and satisfy better the needs of the users.
 *
 * The LikeBack system has 5 components:
 * @li In the application: The comment dialog, where the user write a comment, select a type of comment, etc.
 * @li In the application: The QAction to plug in the Help menu. This action displays the comment dialog.
 * @li In the application: The button-bar, that floats bellow titlebar of every windows of the application, and let the user to quickly show the comment dialog.
 *                         The button-bar can be hidden.
 * @li On the server: A PHP script that collects every comments that users send. The LikeBack object should be configured to contact that server.
 * @li On the server: The developer interface. It lists every comments that were sent, let you sort them, add remarks to them, and mark them as fixed or another status.
 *
 * Here is an example of code to call to quickly setup LikeBack on the client:
 * @code
 *     // Instantiate the LikeBack system, and show the first-use information dialog if the button-bar is shown:
 *     LikeBack *likeBack = new LikeBack(LikeBack::AllButtons, LikeBack::isDevelopmentVersion(KGlobal::mainComponent().aboutData->version())); // Show button-bar only in beta-versions
 *     likeBack->setServer("myapp.kde.org", "/likeback/send.php");
 *     likeBack->setAcceptedLanguages(QStringList::split(";", "en;fr"), i18n("Please write in English or French."));
 *
 *     // Comment the following line once you are sure all your windows have a name:
 *     likeBack->setWindowNamesListing(LikeBack::WarnUnnamedWindows);
 *
 *     // This line should be called early in your KMainWindow constructor because it references actionCollection().
 *     // It should be called before createGUI() for the action to be plugged in the Help menu:
 *     likeBack->sendACommentAction(actionCollection());
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see Visit https://basket.kde.org/likeback.php for more information, screenshots, a tutorial, hints, return of experiences, and to download the server-side developer interface...
